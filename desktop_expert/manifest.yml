  This app will launch an interactive desktop on one or more compute nodes. You
  will have full access to the resources these nodes provide. This is analogous
  to an interactive batch job.

  To start the job promptly, use the redwood-shared-short account and partition. Choose the number of CPU cores and length of the job and push the **Launch** button. 

  Memory and [GPU specification] are optional.
