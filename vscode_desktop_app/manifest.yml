  This app will launch a [VSCode] IDE on a [HPC cluster] or on a [Frisco node]. You will be able
  to interact with the VSCode IDE through a VNC session.

  [GPU specification] is optional for the partitions that have them.

  NOTE: To **initially** set up GitHub Copilot, follow these steps:

  1. Open a FastX XFCE remote desktop or OnDemand Interactive Desktop session
  2. Change the default browser from Firefox to Chrome
    - Select upper left corner menu Applications - Settings - Default Applications
    - Replace Mozilla Firefox with Google Chrome under the Web Browser pull-down
  3. Start this VSCode Desktop app, find and install the GitHub Copilot extension
  4. Click on the User symbol in the lower left corner and choose Sign in GitHub to use GitHub Copilot.
  5. A Chrome browser window will appear with a dialog window talking about XDG, approve that and a `Failed to open URI` window will show. Click Close on the window, and close Chrome - this authentication way does not work because of a missing browser plugin in our OS installation
  6. Click Cancel in the VSCode Github authentication window, it will offer to `try a different way`. Click Yes to that.
  7. After some time another browser window pops up saying `You are signed in`. Close the browser, VSCode should be signed to GitHub and Copilot should be available.

  After this you may just need to periodically re-authenticate following steps 4-7.
