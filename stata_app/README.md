# Batch Connect - CHPC STATA


A Batch Connect app designed for Open OnDemand that launches STATA on a CHPC infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

This Batch Connect app requires the following software be installed on the
**compute nodes** that the batch job is intended to run on (**NOT** the
OnDemand node):

- [STATA] 
- [Xfce Desktop] 4+

For VNC server support:

- [TurboVNC] 2.1+
- [websockify] 0.8.0+

For hardware rendering support (not on CHPC):

- [X server] (CHPC does not run X server on compute nodes)
- [VirtualGL] 2.3+

**Optional** software:

- [Lmod] 6.0.1+ or any other `module purge` and `module load <modules>` based
  CLI used to load appropriate environments within the batch job
